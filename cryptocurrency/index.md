Cryptocurrencies, most popularly Bitcoin, are becoming a popular alternative to credit cards payments online. Cryptocurrencies are a digital currency based on cryptography and provide some benefits such as anonymous transactions and lower transaction fees. 

A key difference with cryptocurrencies compared to credit card payments and ACH is that it operates on a "push" rather than a "pull" model. This means that you don't charge a bitcoin address like you would a credit card number, instead your customer would send you coins (the common nomenclature for a cryptocurrency) to your wallet. This also means that subscription and recurring payments are not supported at the protocol level.

Accepting cryptocurrencies can be pretty easy with a number of companies allow you accept cryptocurrencies in only a few lines of code. Also a number of credit card processing companies (like Stripe and Braintree) have added Bitcoin support to their API.

While credit card payments can be confirmed instantly, cryptocurrencies often have a delay while payment confirmation propagates across the network. Many merchant APIs though support instant confirmations.
