Levels in the PCI world are based on the number of transactions you process anually. They are network-specific, meaning that AmEx, Discover, Mastercard, Visa, etc. have different levels.

- [American Express levels](https://www209.americanexpress.com/merchant/singlevoice/dsw/FrontServlet?request_type=dsw&pg_nm=merchinfo&ln=en&frm=US&tabbed=merchantLevel)
- [Discover levels](http://www.discovernetwork.com/merchants/data-security/identifying-organizations.html)
- [Mastercard levels](http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/whatwedo/determine_merchant.html#SDP-Tables)

# Visa

[See full Visa levels and information.](http://usa.visa.com/merchants/protect-your-business/cisp/merchant-pci-dss-compliance.jsp#anchor_4)

If you fall under levels 2, 3, or 4, you must fill out a [Self Assessment Questionnaire](/payment-cards/pci-compliance/saqs/) annually or receive an Attestation of Compliance letter from a [Qualified Security Assessor](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/become_qsa.php). You must also undergo an external network scan quarterly (if you have public-facing IPs).

Level | Annual Transactions
-----|-----
Level 1 | Over 6 million
Level 2 | 1 million to 6 million
Level 3 | 20,000 to 1 million
Level 4 | Under 20,000
