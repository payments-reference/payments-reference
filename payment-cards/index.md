Payment cards refer to devices, normally plastic cards, that enable customers to make electronic payments. Typically these refer to credit and debit cards, however, they may also refer to store cards, stored-value cards, ATM cards, and fleet cards. Payment cards typically have a card number issued to them that confirms with the [ISO/IEC 7812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7812) numbering standard. 

Members of the payments card industry (American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa International) formed the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council in 2006 with the purpose of managing the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS. PCI DSS is the set of standards that businesses may measure their own payment card security policies, procedures and guidelines. Compliance with PCI DSS is necessary to accept payment cards. Additional information on PCI compliance can be found on our [PCI Compliance](/payment-cards/pci-compliance/) page
