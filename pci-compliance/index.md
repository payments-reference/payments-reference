The [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) is a set of rules developed by the major credit card issuers.

If you have a data breach or process a large volume of transactions and do not abide by these rules, you may be fined.

If you're handling under a certain amount of transaction volume, you can fill out a Self Assessment Questionnaire that reduces your liability in the event of a breach.

#### See [SAQs (Self Assessment Questionnaires)](/pci-compliance/saqs/)

The SAQ you are eligible to fill out is highly dependent on your payment integration method.

#### See [The PCI burden of various integrations](/pci-compliance/integrations/)
