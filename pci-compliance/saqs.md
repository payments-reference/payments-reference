To be [PCI Compliant](/pci-compliance/) as a merchant, you'll need to fill out an SAQ, or Self Assessment Questionnaire.

Under PCI DSS v3: there are 3 SAQ's an e-commerce merchant can fall under.


# SAQ A

The easiest. Requires use of an iframe or a redirect so that payment information is entered directly on the [provider's](/glossary/#provider) domain.

# SAQ A-EP

# SAQ D

Everything else.

# Questions

There's also PCI Level 1, does that fit into the SAQ scale? (those are based on volume https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/pci-faqs-2/#5, will add later)
